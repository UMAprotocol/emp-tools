            <li>
              <strong>"Fast" withdrawal: </strong>Instantly withdraw collateral
              until your positions collateralization ratio is equal to the
              global collateralization ratio. For your position you can
              instantly withdraw {fastWithdrawableCollateral} {collSymbol}.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"Slow" withdrawal: </strong> To withdraw past the global
              collateralization ratio, you will need to wait a livness period
              before compleating your withdrawal. For this EMP this is{" "}
              {liquidationLiveness &&
                Math.floor(liquidationLiveness.toNumber() / (60 * 60))}{" "}
              hours. When preforming this kind of withdrawal one must ensure
              that their position is sufficiently collateralized after the
              withdrawal or you risk being liquidated.
