              We fetch Balancer pool data from the Balancer subgraph API, which
              is currently returning inaccurate information. Instead of
              displaying inaccurate data, we redirect you to the Balancer pool
              and exchange interfaces where you can access accurate on-chain
              information. This fix has no ETA yet, but we will revert back to
              the old display as soon as the data is accurate. Apologies for the
              inconvenience!

              contracts will be eligible for liquidity mining. 10,000 UMA and
              25,000 UMA, respectively, are granted pro-rata (based on
              continuous snapshots) to LP's in the uUSDwBTC-USDC and uUSDwETH
              Balancer pools.

              divide the $ amount of UMA rewarded for a pool per week by the $
              amount of pooled liquidity. For example, if the pool size is $10
              million, the UMA-USD price is $10, and the reward is 25,000
              UMA/week, then the return for each $1 supplied to the pool is:{" "}
